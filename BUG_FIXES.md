# Bug Fixes for Pinned Private Messages

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Private Messages Not Persisting Through Refreshes
**Problem**: Pinned private messages were not being restored on page refresh.

**Root Cause**: The system was already loading pinned PMs correctly, but there was a timing issue with MONITOR and WHO commands not being sent for existing PM tabs.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `openPrivateChat` to send MONITOR, WHO, and METADATA requests even when opening an existing private chat
- This ensures status and metadata are refreshed when switching to a PM tab

### 2. âœ… User Avatar Not Showing in Private Message Window  
**Problem**: User avatars were not displayed in the private message chat header.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ChatHeader.tsx` to fetch user metadata from localStorage
- Added avatar display with fallback to default user icon
- Included status indicator (green/yellow/grey) on the avatar
- Display user's custom status text if available

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/layout/ChatHeader.tsx`: Added avatar, status indicator, and metadata display

### 3. âœ… Status Indicator Not Showing Yellow for Away Users
**Problem**: Status indicator wasn't correctly detecting away status from WHO responses.

**Root Cause**: WHO responses were being parsed correctly (H=Here, G=Gone), but:
1. WHO wasn't being requested for private chat users
2. Private chat state wasn't being updated from WHO responses
3. WHO_END handler didn't account for individual user WHO queries

**Solution**:
- Added WHO request when opening private chats (both new and existing)
- Updated `WHO_REPLY` handler to also update private chat status
- Updated `WHO_END` handler to handle both channel and individual user WHO queries
- Properly set `isAway` flag based on WHO flags (H vs G)

**WHO Flag Parsing**:
```
H = Here (green indicator)
G = Gone/Away (yellow indicator)
No response = Offline (grey indicator)
```

**Files Changed**:
- `src/store/index.ts`: 
  - Modified `openPrivateChat` to send WHO command
  - Updated `WHO_REPLY` handler to update private chats
  - Enhanced `WHO_END` handler for individual users

### 4. âœ… Incorrect METADATA UNSUB Command
**Problem**: When closing a private message, the code was sending `METADATA * UNSUB avatar status url website`, which unsubscribes globally from those keys.

**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of METADATA protocol. METADATA SUB/UNSUB is global and applies to keys, not per-user. Once subscribed to a key like "avatar", you receive updates for that key for all users you share channels with or monitor.

**Solution**:
- Removed the incorrect `metadataUnsub` call when closing private chats
- METADATA subscriptions remain global - we only MONITOR - the specific user
- Metadata will automatically stop being received for users we don't share channels with and aren't monitoring

**Files Changed**:
- `src/store/index.ts`: Removed global UNSUB call from `deletePrivateChat`

## How It Works Now

### Opening a Private Message

When a PM is opened (new or existing):
1. **MONITOR +** username â†’ Server will notify us when user goes online/offline
2. **WHO** username â†’ Get current status (H=green, G=yellow, no response=grey)
3. **METADATA GET** avatar status url website â†’ Get user's metadata

### Private Message Display

The chat header now shows:
- User's avatar (if they have one set)
- Status indicator:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Online and here
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Online but away  
  - âš« Grey = Offline
- User's custom status message (if set)

### Status Updates

Real-time updates via:
- **MONITOR** (730/731 numerics): Online/Offline changes
- **AWAY** events (extended-monitor): Away status changes
- **METADATA** events: Avatar and status text changes

### Persistence

Pinned PMs are:
1. Saved to localStorage with order
2. Restored on server connection
3. MONITOR + sent for all pinned users
4. WHO and METADATA requested for each

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Open a PM â†’ WHO command sent
- [x] User's avatar appears in chat header
- [x] Status indicator shows correct color (H=green, G=yellow)
- [x] Pin a PM â†’ Persists through refresh
- [x] Drag pinned PMs â†’ Order persists
- [x] Close unpinned PM â†’ MONITOR - sent (no METADATA UNSUB)
- [x] User goes away â†’ Indicator turns yellow
- [x] User comes back â†’ Indicator turns green
- [x] User goes offline â†’ Indicator turns grey
- [x] Metadata updates â†’ Avatar/status updates in real-time

## Protocol Compliance

âœ… **MONITOR (IRCv3)**: Fully compliant with RFC
âœ… **extended-monitor**: Integrates with away-notify correctly
âœ… **METADATA (draft/metadata-2)**: Correctly uses global SUB, per-target GET
âœ… **WHO (RFC 1459)**: Properly parses H/G flags
